    <p class="content-element ready name">hiii! i'm siobhan (or vonnie) :3</p>
    <p class="content-element ready"> i'm a self-taught systems developer who's obsessed a very normal amount with game console history. i've written emulators, operating systems and their kernels, compilers, virtual machines, so on so forth. you name it, i've probably made a half-baked toy implementation at the <i>very</i> least. i'm not very good at using my github, but i'm trying <i>reeeaaaallllyyyy</i> hard with my current project. i promise.</p>
    <p class="content-element ready">my other, less development specific hobbies include making clothes for myself and friends (and other similar crafts, crochet, leatherwork, so on), <a href="https://fable.co/vonnie-132295956111" target="_blank">reading</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rvvvr" target="_blank">playing awesome video games</a>, ripping sound chips out of old, dead game consoles, and going for really long walks way later than is safe to do so.</p>
    <p class="content-element ready">i'm also in school! i go to sfu, studying linguistics at the moment. i just love language so much!!!!!!!! i'd like to go on and get a PhD in this subject one day,, become a professor.</p>
